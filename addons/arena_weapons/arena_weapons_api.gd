## arena-weapons' API level. The rule for bumping it is on [DotAddonApi].
##
## LEVEL rises by one for anything a game could call that did not exist before. OLDEST is
## raised to LEVEL when something a game could have called is removed or changes meaning.

# 1: role skins (role_art, art_rows, spawn_entries, credits) and the aw_* weapon clones.
# 2: AwWeaponPack owns 24 weapon definitions with plain ids (set_id_prefix, weapon_defs), 14 new
#    models, cfg/addons/arena_weapons/weapon/<id>.yml tuning, aims that keep the stock clear of the eye.
